# -Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
An obstacle-avoiding robot project involves designing and constructing a robotic car capable 
of automatically navigating through an environment while avoiding obstacles in its path. 
Typically, such a robot is equipped with sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors, to detect obstacles
and determine their proximity. The robotâ€™s control system processes sensors data to make realtime decisions, adjusting its direction or speed to avoid obstacles.
In a typical obstacle-avoiding robot project, the hardware components include motors for 
movement, wheels for mobility, a chassis to hold the components together, and a 
microcontroller to serve as the brain of the robot. Key to the obstacle avoidance functionality 
are distance sensors, commonly ultrasonic sensors, which emit signals and measure the time 
it takes for the signals to bounce back after hitting an obstacle. The microcontroller processes 
this data and triggers the motors to change direction.
Programming plays a crucial role in implementing an efficient obstacle avoidance algorithm
by enabling the robot to interpret sensor data, make informed decisions in real-time, and 
execute precise control commands for motor movements.

## Abstract
The obstacle-avoiding robot project focuses on the development of an autonomous robotic car capable of intelligently navigating its surroundings while evading obstacles. Essential to this project is the integration of sensors, particularly ultrasonic sensors, which enable the robot to detect obstacles and dynamically adjust its path to avoid collisions.
